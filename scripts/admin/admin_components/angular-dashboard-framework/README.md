# angular-dashboard-framework

> Dashboard framework with Angular.js and Twitter Bootstrap.

The api of angular-dashboard-framework (adf) is documented [here](http://sdorra.github.io/angular-dashboard-framework/docs/). A getting
started guide can be found [here](https://github.com/sdorra/angular-dashboard-framework/wiki/Getting-started).
Follow me ([@ssdorra](https://twitter.com/ssdorra)) on twitter for latest updates and news about adf.

## Demo

A live demo of the adf can be viewed [here](http://sdorra.github.io/angular-dashboard-framework/). The demo uses html5 localStorage to store the state of the dashboard. The source of the demo can be found [here](https://github.com/sdorra/angular-dashboard-framework/tree/master/sample).

A more dynamic example can be found [here](https://github.com/sdorra/adf-dynamic-example).
